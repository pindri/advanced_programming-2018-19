By default members of a struct are pubblic, while members of a class are private. Both can contain both data and functions. They are basically the same. Note that even if you can define function inside classes it make your program heavier: they are put inline. If I have a big function I do not want that. If you declare the function outside the class then it gets referenced, not copiet when executed. The compiler may put some short functions inline anyways.\n",
