The constructor of a derived class constructs the base class first, then adds whatever the derived class has to add. The destructor works the other way around. So you **need** to call the constructor of the base class first, and then the specific derived class constructor. \n",

NOTE: even if the destructor does nothing, it should be marked `virtual` anyways. A virtual function can be then overrided by `override`, which is a contestual keyword that looks for the function to override: in case of a typo or an error the compiler complains.
