    "Some of the features Python has, come from *ABC*, a programming language designed for entry level programmers. Indentation is one of those features. Python is almost as old as c++, but a completely different language: Python is an *interpreted* language, while c++ is a *compiled* language. Python is a language (it has its documentation that states how it behaves), the most used implementation of Python is *CPython*, which is written in C. Not to be confused with *Cython*, a Python package that is useful for optimization.\n",
