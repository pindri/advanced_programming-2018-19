    "If I say `import my_module` somewhere, locally, that phyton file must be present. Importing a module creates a namespace (you need the fully qualifing name) which can be assigned to an alias, importing a function puts it in the global namespace, you can just call it. If you import all with `*`, you can call without the namespace-name. NOTE: `*` imports all that is contained in the `__all__=['','',...]` list. If that is not defined, that it means 'import everything'. Printing `sys.path` shows the directories in which Python looks for module. The first one is empty and represents the current directory (it is the firt to be checked). \n",
